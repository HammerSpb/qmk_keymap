# Kyria Keymap

This is my keymap for the [Kyria rev3](https://github.com/splitkb/kyria). 

It was heavily inspired by [Pascal Getreuer's keymap](https://github.com/getreuer/qmk-keymap). It uses a `Qwerty` base layer with an option to switch to `Colemak-DH`. I spent a lot of time trying to design a very efficient symbol layer for programming. To do so, I referred heavily to character and bigram frequencies in programming langues.

The keymap is compiled using a GitHub action.

## Layers

- `Qwerty` base layer
- Symbol layer optimized for coding including `0` and `1`
- Numpad layer
- [Extend Layer](https://dreymar.colemak.org/layers-extend.html) used for navigation
- Gaming layer with numbers and `qwerty` row
- TBD: option to switch to `Colemak-DH`

## Features

- [Caps Word](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_caps_word)
- [Repeat Key](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_repeat_key)
- [Word Selection](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/select-word/index.html) macro
- [Layer Lock](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/layer-lock/index.html) macro
- `../` key in symbol layer
- Layer keys activated by the thumbs via mod-tap.
- TBD: Home row mods?

I will add pictures once I am done playing around with the exact layout.
